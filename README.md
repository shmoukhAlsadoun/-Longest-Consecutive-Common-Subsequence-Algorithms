# -Longest-Consecutive-Common-Subsequence-Algorithms
This repository contains Java code for finding the longest consecutive common subsequence between two arrays, X and Y. Code 1 uses a brute-force algorithm (O(n^4)), while Code 2 offers an optimized approach (O(n^3)). Compare their performance and optimize further for efficiency.
